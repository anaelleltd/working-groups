# Working groups
This repository hosts the list and description of all working groups administered by the Polkadot Technical Fellowship. 

## Purpose
Working groups are a social collaboration mechanism aiming to support the development and maintenance of the specific technologies defined in Section 2.3.1 of the [Manifesto](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/manifesto/blob/main/manifesto.pdf).

Working groups do not constitute a change to the Manifesto: they only seek to optimise productivity within the Technical Fellowship and improve communications with ecosystem developers and users.

## Structure
Working groups are organised around two distinct roles: **Leaders** and **Participants**.

**Leaders** are responsible for: 
- Proposing/creating ad hoc working groups
- Designing and planning internal tasks
- Decision-making and calls to action
- Reviewing targets and success metrics
- Collaboration with other working groups
- Supporting participants

**Participants**' duties include:
- Reviewing related RFCs
- Providing technical support
- Development & maintenance of related code
- Participation in technical discussions

Anyone can join/leave a working group as a participant at any time. 
Active Rank 3+ members are required to join at least one working group as a **participant**.
Active Rank 5+ members are required to become the **leader** of at least one working group.
A working group can have up to 3 leaders.

Each working group should have a public discussion channel so that external contributors can access related technical information, resources, and support.


## Process
TODO

## Recommendations
After an initial set of working groups (e.g. FRAME, XCM, Trustless bridges, etc.) has been defined, it should be possible to create ad hoc working groups (e.g. Plaza, Minimal Relay, etc.) to mirror the evolution of the Polkadot roadmap.

Initially, it is expected that working groups will prioritise reviewing existing RFCs and overseeing their implementation, which will be used as a measure of their effectiveness in the short-term.

## Communication channels
The Fellowship is using Matrix for communication. Right now there exists two channels:
- [Polkadot Technical Fellowship Channel](https://matrix.to/#/#fellowship-members:parity.io): The channel for all Fellowship members to discuss. To get voice rights, you need to be part of the Fellowship. However, the channel is readable by anyone.
- [Polkadot Technical Fellowship - Open Channel](https://matrix.to/#/#fellowship-open-channel:parity.io): Open channel for anyone. Should be used to reach out to the Fellowship e.g. to request review or help on a topic.
