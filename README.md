# Working groups
This repository hosts the list and description of all working groups administered by the Polkadot Technical Fellowship. 

## Purpose
Working groups are a social collaboration mechanism aiming to support the development and maintenance of the specific technologies defined in Section 2.3.1 of the [Manifesto](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/manifesto/blob/main/manifesto.pdf).

Working groups do not constitute a change to the Manifesto: they only seek to optimise productivity within the Technical Fellowship and improve communications with ecosystem developers and users.


## Structure
Working groups are organised around two distinct roles: **Leaders** and **Participants**.

**Leaders** are responsible for: 
- Proposing/creating ad hoc working groups
- Designing and planning internal tasks
- Decision-making and calls to action
- Reviewing targets and success metrics
- Collaboration with other working groups
- Supporting participants

**Participants**' duties include:
- Reviewing related RFCs
- Providing technical support
- Development & maintenance of related code
- Participation in technical discussions

Anyone can join/leave a working group as a participant at any time. 
Active Rank 3+ members are required to join at least one working group as a **participant**.
Active Rank 5+ members are required to become the **leader** of at least one working group.

Each working group should have a public discussion channel so that external contributors can access related technical information, resources, and support.
